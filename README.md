# videoscraper
A Python script to scrape text information over time from a video or stream

## Genesis
This script was conceived as a means to record the lap timings and speed
of the 2018 "24 Hours of LRRMans" twitch stream by LoadingReadyRun's
Ian Horner.

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome.
Please, use the `git flow` branching scheme.
Just submit a pull request for your branch.

(The following is taken from Linus Torvalds' Subsurface README:)

Also, please write good git commit messages.  A good commit message
looks like this:

	Header line: explain the commit in one line (use the imperative)

	Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
	in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
	being fixed, etc etc.

	The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
	please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
	74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
	nicely even when it's indented.

	Make sure you explain your solution and why you're doing what you're
	doing, as opposed to describing what you're doing. Reviewers and your
	future self can read the patch, but might not understand why a
	particular solution was implemented.

where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
independently of the longer explanation. Please use verbs in the
imperative in the commit message, as in "Fix bug that...", "Add
file/feature ...", or "Make Videoscraper..."
